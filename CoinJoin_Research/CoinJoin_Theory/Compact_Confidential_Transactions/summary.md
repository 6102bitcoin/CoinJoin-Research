Dev: mixles

A pdf was posted detailing mixles work on Compact Confidential Transactions which greg described as 'super exciting and important' [link](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1085436.msg11646936#msg11646936), though there was no code. 
A problem was identified by Andrew Poelstra which resulted in the proofs being less compact than initially hoped.
